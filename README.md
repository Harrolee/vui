# an interruptible vui

## now

- code that generates timestamps works. The beeps are quite charming
- code that embeds timestamps into audio does not work. The result is horrifying. listen to ../data/7seconds-signatureAdded.wav
- look into embedSignature()

### debugging

- listen to the wav after the first embedding loop
